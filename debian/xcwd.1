.SH NAME
xcwd \- X current working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xcwd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xcwd
is a simple tool which prints the current working directory of the focused
window.
It's useful for launching applications directly into the same directory as the
focused application\(emfor instance, you might want to launch a new terminal in
the same directory as your editor.
You can make this happen by binding something like
.sp
.RS
.EX
urxvt \-cd "$(xcwd)"
.EE
.RE
.sp
to a keyboard shortcut within your window manager and then invoking that
shortcut during editor usage.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B xcwd
exits with a nonzero status if it can't figure out the working directory
associated with the currently focused window and $HOME is unset.
Otherwise,
.B xcwd
returns zero.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
If
.B xcwd
can't figure out the working directory associated with the currently focused
window, it falls back on $HOME.

algorithm fails when applied to most single-instance applications, applications
